Eos is the best Elemental Battlegrounds user interface; then, now, forever. Eos has multiple features to help improve your gameplay, from speedhacks to performance boosters.

---

## Disclaimer

**Eos Staff, including its developers, takes no responsibility for any consequences of improperly using Eos and/or its features.** Using any user interface like Eos in unintended or malicious manners may get your account banned from Elemental Battlegrounds or Roblox.

## Terms and Conditions

You can view the Terms and Conditions for using this script [at this link.](https://bit.ly/EosTnC) While using Eos and its features, you will be bound by these terms; read them carefully.

## Loading

To use Eos, you will require an executor. [Synapse](x.synapse.to) and [Script-Ware](https://script-ware.com/) are examples of paid executors, while [Krnl](https://krnl.vip/) is an example of a free one. Not all executors may be supported; submit a ticket in our Discord for more information. Then, attach/inject the executor into your game, usually via a button (though some auto-inject).

Eos Passkey will start once you execute, requesting you provide the Passkey for your given Membership. You can find this at the Discord server.

## Features

Features of Eos include, but are not limited to;

- Long-range attacks
- Infinite Sprint
- Detailed ESP
- Reduced Mana

This list is not comprehensive, and more features may be added as time goes on. See the changelog below for more information.

## Contributions

If you have any contributions, fixes, or additions you wish to include in Eos, you can visit the appropriate channel in the Eos Discord to submit them. Alternatively, you may also contact me using the email in the "Contact Me" badge above. We can discuss the details as needed there.

## FAQs

### Problems loading/using Eos

When loading Eos, you'll should first be greeted with Eos Passkey, our proprietary passkey system. You'll need to provide the Passkey associated with your membership **and press Enter**; you can find this in the provided announcements channel for it (Basic being in #script-announcements). 

#### Eos Passkey doesn't accept your passkey, with an error

If you enter your Passkey and are greeted with the error sound and red text, your Key is either incorrect or outdated. You'll need to ensure that you've properly copied and pasted/typed your Passkey, and that you're using the most up-to-date version. Promo keys will not tell you whether they are expired.

#### Eos Passkey doesn't accept your passkey, without an error

If you enter your Passkey and nothing happens, first ensure you've actually hit Enter on your keyboard, rather than just leaving the textbox or hitting the Close button. If nothing happens (no error sound, no red text), but it doesn't accept your Passkey, open a ticket with us.

#### Eos Passkey fails to open; notification appears saying you've been blocked

Hold This L, Bozo:tm:. This message means you've been blocked from using Eos, pursuant of I.D1 of the Eos Terms. Please read the Terms, then visit [the ban appeal form.](https://bit.ly/EosBanAppeal)

#### Eos Passkey fails to open; a crash report was made, or a Luau error was provided

**Please join open a ticket as soon as you can.** This means something went wrong that Eos couldn't handle. Once you've opened a ticket, provide us with the crash report and/or error that was created. The crash report can be found in your executor's Workspace folder, in a subfolder made by and for Eos itself.

### How to obtain a Key

**User-specific keys will *NOT* be provided under any circumstances.**

The key for your membership can be found on the proper updates channel dedicated to it; e.g., Dawn members would go to the Dawn updates channel. The standard key is in the standard script announcements channel. If you can't see it, you need to verify via the RoVer bot in its channel to do so. Please check its pins.

### Fixes and Feature Suggestions

If you have a fix, workaround, or feature suggestion, we'd love to hear it! Send a suggestion in the bots channel. Not all suggestions can or will be implemented, but those that do will also be added to Eos' credits.

### About Blocks

If you got blocked, you can file a **one-time** appeal at <https://bit.ly/EosBanAppeal>. Keep in mind you are **not** guaranteed to be unblocked, and you will **not** receive notification on whether you have been unblocked or not.

## Eos and EBG bans

1. As stated in the disclaimer above *and* in section IC of the Eos Terms, due to the nature of how scripts work, you may find yourself banned via the use of *anything*, let alone Eos. Eos Staff *cannot* do anything to assist with bans. If you bought an Eos membership, your key will still work on other accounts.
2. Please make a ticket with us in the Discord server, and explain the feature you were using until you were banned. We'll investigate, and determine whether a game update or change caused problems with the feature, and whether a fix is possible.

## Eos Dusk, Twilight, and Dawn

Eos Dusk, Twilight, and Dawn are our premium membership-based bonus features services that gets you even *more* than what Eos provides at its base.

### Upgrading your Membership

When we introduced a few changes to Eos, we determined there were a fair amount of spells and hacks that were just too overpowered for the average user to take advantage of. We also, however, didn't just want to remove the features entirely. Our solution, then, was three-fold; it provides a method for you, the user, to help donate to our cause, provides you with exclusivity, and prevents servers from being overrun by those abusing the overpowered nature of some features.

Aside from a cheeky startup message thanking you for being a subscriber of any form, subscribing and upgrading your Membership grants you access to a select portion of hacks that Basic members aren't able to use. These are designated by a distinct coloring, and are some of the most powerful features Eos can offer!

### How to Upgrade

Becoming a Member is quick and easy, and only involves a few bits of setup from you;

1. Join the Eos Discord
2. Become a [Patreon Patron](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=78750394), Discord Booster, or Discord Server Subscriber
    - If you became a Patron, connect your Discord account to Patreon. You can ensure that it's been connected, afterwards, by visiting your User Settings and going to the Authorized Apps section.

It's just that easy. Use the tier-specific Passkey provided, and you'll be on your way!

### Membership Passkey Sharing

Pursuant to section IF.1.A of the Eos Terms, membership keys are *not* to be given to other users. Those who want the current Membership key for their tier are required to go through the same methods every member uses; checking the appropriate Discord channel. Please refer to the [Eos Terms and Conditions](https://bit.ly/EosTnC) for more information regarding this.

### Promotional Membership Passkeys

Promotional Passkeys have hard-coded time-bombs in them, and will expire on the provided date and time as was advertised. When using a Promotional key, your loading splash message well tell you exactly when your Promotional key will expire.

## Credits

SHA256 implementation was found open-source and modified from [GravityScore on ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/8169-sha-256-in-pure-lua/).

Reduced Mana was created and provided for use in Eos by happyplay0988 and CHAOSLORD_666; thank you for the assistance!

## Changelog

<sup>Entries in this changelog are denoted by using asterisks (*) for changes, pluses (+) for additions, and dashes (-) for removals.</sup>

### Latest - v4.3.1

- [`*`] Fixed Basic Paskeys not working on occasion
- [`*`] Masterlist users are now not prompted for Eos Passkey

### Previous

#### v4.3 Yonkers

- [`+`] Added Eos Passkey
  - Eos Passkey is a new, even more secure method for loading Eos than before. Rather than loading from a key variable stored in plaintext within the code, Eos Passkey utilizes a hashing system that lets you load in and provide the given passkey for your membership.
- [`+`] Hiding Eos now has a physical button as well as its original keybind; credit to Lightking321532
  - The keybind for hiding Eos was always there, it was just never listed.
- [`+`] Added Infinite Jump
- [`*`] Changed how keybinds are shown.
  - This is a cosmetic issue at best, but was done to prevent confusion for the hide Eos keybind.
- [`*`] Notifications are now multi-threaded.
  - Originally, notifications were handled on the main thread, which meant certain actions that show notifications (e.g., hiding Eos) were forced to yield until the notification cleared. Now, notifications are multi-threaded and will not prevent Eos from continuing.
- [`*`] Randomized shard colors will no longer trigger conflict check with target viewing or Holobeam camera.
- [`*`] Fixed Detailed ESP having incorrect text for Stamina.
- [`+`] Detailed ESP will now show the location of the user when viewing a target.
  - Basic ESP will *not* be getting this same feature.
- [`*`] Fixed Basic ESP not properly showing percentage; credit to Austin200wasd
- [`*`] Fixed moves that don't require targets to work not firing if one is provided; credit to Austin200wasd
  - Specifically, this means; Genesis Ray, Mid-air Rock Fist, Crystal Armament, Lightning Flash (if "To mouse" is selected), Echoes (if "At mouse" is selected), and Lightning Bolt (if "At mouse" is selected).
  - An internal check was not checking for these moves with a target provided, meaning these moves were never being made to fire.
- [`*`] Made Eos only draggable from the title bar
  - Eos had an issue in which clicking on any other UI overtop of it would drag it as well. To mitigate this, similar to how operating systems work, the window for Eos can now only be dragged if you're clicking and holding the title bar.
- [`*`] Fixed issue when hiding Eos while it was below half the screen; credit to Pikachuinfinit
  - The animation calculated incorrectly and would fail to send off-screen properly.
  - A further issue was found when dragging an improperly hidden Eos in which doing so would prevent it from hiding at all.
- [`*`] Changed the keybind for Teleport to Mouse from J to X
- [`-`] Removed the restrictions of some AoE moves' heights being lesser than 0.
- [`+`] Added low-gravity
  - Low gravity is the equivalent of pre-v3.6 "Inertia Gravity", renamed since it doesn't actually use Inertia. Enabling low-gravity and disabling stun gives a no-particles equivalent of Inertia.
- [`+`] Added anti-lag
  - Anti-lag was intended at Eos' launch, but was never added. Anti-lag currently clears lag from Tech, Angel, and some other decals that cause chronic lag, including Light Disc.
- [`*`] Fixed an issue with Explosive Leap performing a conflict check with Shields instead of Teleports
  - This same bug was somehow causing Explosive Leap to outright not fire.
- [`*`] Fixed "Click" Target setting causing aim with certain moves to become erratic and incorrect
- [`*`] Fixed being able to "use" Rock Armor and Flame Body if you were in safezone
  - While you never actively "used" it to the degree of losing mana, it would still attempt to, playing the select sound. You'll now get a proper error if you try to use it in Safezone.
- [`*`] Renamed "Going up?" to "No gravity"

#### v4.2 Utica

- [`+`] Added punch aura as a Twilight feature
  - Punch aura is unaffected by target settings and is set to punch the nearest player
  - Due to how it works, users may find a performance impact when using the punch aura. A workaround is being devised, but users with low-end systems may want to avoid this feature.
- [`+`] Added super armor as a Dawn feature
  - Using an Ultimate hack or other modification move (such as Angelic Aura, Rock Armor, etc.) will cancel out the super armor. This is undetectable by nature and will require a reset/refresh.
- [`+`] Re-added Infinite Sprint as a Dusk feature
  - The new implementation of Infinite Sprint was failing to wait for a proper value, and thus, wasn't ever setting correctly.
- [`*`] Settings menu input boxes now show default values
  - Input boxes will also show the default value when resetting them.
- [`+`] Added Rock Armor
- [`+`] Added Flame Body
  - Flame Body and Rock Armor will fire instantly on button press, similarly to how Rock Armor worked pre-v4.
  - Both have their own keybinds, T and G (respectively)
  - Neither of these will be infinite, as this was patched a while ago.
- [`+`] Added reduced mana as a Dawn feature
- [`*`] Heal keybind is now functioning properly
- [`*`] Made Ultimate cooldown removal Dusk versus Twilight
- [`*`] Moved Infinite Sprint to the Transportation menu
- [`*`] Fixed problem with Gravital Globe conflict checking Blast moves
- [`*`] Fixed issue where move combos were not possible
  - Previous checks prevented the game from using multiple moves at once was impossible, because it was checking if only one move was active, not all. This error has been fixed, and now you can use any move in combination (provided conflict checks allow).
- [`+`] Added Auto-level
  - Auto-leveling works as a toggle and will constantly run in the background. It allows those above level 225 to level automatically without needing to visit Grass map. It will not fire the cap increase if you are below level 225, and will only fire if your EXP is at max.

#### v4.1 Syracuse

- [`*`] Fixed issue with membership detection
  - Eos was not detecting memberships properly, and despite having Dawn or Twilight, you would not have access to features below it.
- [`+`] Added SmartAttack toggle
- [`+`] Added attack looping toggle
- [`+`] Added target setting selection
  - Options are; "Manual", "Closest", "Farthest", "Highest HP", "Lowest HP", and "Click". "Manual" replaces pre-v4 `;targetsetting select` option, but ultimately does the same.
  - Pre-v4 `;targetsetting kos` will not be added into Eos in the near future, as properly implementing it proves impossible.
- [`*`] Fixed color changing shards being single-threaded
  - A misconception in how multithreading would work caused shards to pause if an issue came up. Now, all shards will change simultaneously.
- [`*`] Color-changing shards will now check that they're of a certain color
- [`*`] Fixed SmartAttack not finding player properly
- [`*`] Fixed issue with Detailed ESP causing some lag
- [`*`] Eos will now properly designate color depending on membership
- [`*`] Viewing a target that has died will reset the camera when they respawn
- [`*`] Resetting your target while viewing them will disable viewing

#### v4.0.1 Elmwood Ave

- [`*`] Fixed a bug throwing everyone into debug mode
  - Hope you enjoyed the free Dawn while it lasted

#### v4.0 Buffalo

- [`+`] **Welcome to Eos.**
  - EBGui is now Eos, featuring an easier, cleaner, and faster UI than ever before.
- [`*`] Changed branding and colors
  - With this major update comes a fresh look, and an even fresher color scheme.
- [`+`] Added a notification system
  - Notifications will now appear in the bottom right, located above the party options button (i.e. "Create Party" or "Invite to Party"). Note that this may cover up members or the player list when inviting; simply wait for the notification to go away.
  - This replaces the functionality that EBGui v3.4 and lesser had of the Command Box's text changing to provide updates, and further removes more verbose errors being kept to the console.
- [`+`] Sound effects are now added
  - There are now sound effects for when Eos starts and quits, for when you enable an option, and two seperate sounds for the aforementioned notifications, depending on if it's a success/information, or if an error occurred.
- [`-`] Removed the Command Box
  - Eos no longer utilizes a command box for any of its functionality. All settings and commands that were command-box exclusives now have their own options within their own designated categories -- usually the Settings category.
    - `;antiafk`, `;heal`, `;stun`, `;speed`, `;grcharge`, `;aura/off`, `;refresh`, `;rejoin`, and `;fix` were all moved to have their own buttons in their own categories.
    - `;refresh` and `;rejoin` were both given their own keybinds.
- [`*`] Aura can now be toggled off rather than permanently disabled.
  - An oversight in versions v3.4 and lesser prompted to completely remove a player's Aura from the game, rather than simply toggling it. Now, it can be toggled on and off as if you typed the appropriate commands into chat.
- [`*`] The current target will now be listed on the option itself
  - Please note that modifying the target setting for other than Manual (what was `;targetsetting select`) is not currently possible. Future updates will include this change.
- [`-`] Removed most cosmetic game changes, such as `;magiccolor`.
  - While these may be added later as extra features for Dusk members onwards, at the time, they were simply code hogs and were not important to add in this base release.
  - The functionality of `;drugs` and `;gamecolor` will not be added back in. `;magiccolor`'s functionality may be readded, but it's unknown.
  - `;rain` and `;declutter` have been removed, and there is no intention to re-add them.
  - `;buttonheight` and `;buttongap` were removed as they served to modify the previous version's GUI, which is no longer applicable.
- [`-`] Temporarily removed the ability to disable SmartAttack
  - SmartAttack toggling will be added as soon as possible.
- [`-`] Temporarily removed the ability to enable attack looping.
  - Attack looping will be added as soon as possible.
- [`-`] Removed `;origin`
  - At the time, the idea was considered interesting; it's long outlived its usefulness.
- [`-`] Removed `;help`, `;update`, `;changelog`, and `;info`.
  - The `;help` command originally provided a link to the Docs. Since no command box exists to manually perform complex tasks, it's been opted to remove it.
  - The `;update` command would prompt Eos to see if an update was available. While future updates may find a way to recreate this functionality in a faster and easier way, its current iteration was inefficient and proved useless.
  - The `;info` command, and subcommands `status` and `repo`, provided information about Eos and its current operation (the former subcommand prompting for the current operational status, and the latter providing the current repo link). This was deemed unnecessary to have, and was removed.
  - The `;changelog` command simply copied the link to this very changelog to the user's clipboard. It was deemed useless.
- [`*`] Added specific categories for features
  - Previously, features were simply crammed into one list, very vaguely separated by their move types (where applicable). Now, each feature and option has its own menu depending on what it applies to; e.g, close-ranged moves in the close-ranged category.
- [`-`] Removed `;update`'s functionality
  - The `;update` command from EBGui was considered useless considering the circumstances of how Eos works, and thus, was removed.
- [`*`] The title bar now contains all version and information info
  - Akin to the top bar of the Main Menu in v3.4 and earlier, the tile bar of Eos will contain the version information.
  - The title bar's text color will change depending on the membership option you have. Basic users will have standard white, Dusk will use Void Purple, Twilight will Electric Cyan, and Dawn will use Dawn Pastel Pink.
- [`*`] Various backend changes to improve performance.
  - The issue involving Unmatched Power of the Sun and its animation is still known, but it appears no fix can be implemented as it runs via RenderStepped and can't be interfered with from Eos' end.

#### v3.2.1

- [`*`] Fixed an issue with key registration in which the variable wasn't being registered properly.
- [`+`] Promotional keys will now provide a loading splash in your console (F9) informing you of the date and time of expiry.
- [`+`] Promotional keys will now also be named in the UI itself, next to your username (e.g. "Name | EBGui Promo | Stable"; see [the Docs](/Docs.md) for more information).

#### v3.2

- [`*`] Changed the loadstring a bit! A better system is a happy system.
- [`*`] Changed how keys work. Instead of a specified variable, you just need to use the one `_G` variable.
- [`*`] The `;refresh` command has now had its functionality extended to the keybind "P".
  - Hopefully, this will allow for even quicker refreshes than requiring to type a full command; in the future, the `;refresh` may even be removed in favor of the keybind.
- [`+`] Added `kos` as an option for `;targetsetting`, which takes two arguments; `file` or `link`, and a source list. Choose a source type, the source list location, and EBGui will now target the person topmost on the list who's also in your server.
  - For example, `;targetsetting kos file kos.txt` will pull names or User IDs from a file in your executor's Workspace folder named "kos.txt". For more information on what EBGui expects, visit the repository for the module script made specifically for this feature in mind, [PFL.](https://github.com/EarthToAccess/PFL)
- [`+`] Added `click` as an option for `;targetsetting`, taking no arguments. `click` will let you click on your target to select them, and set it accordingly. It'll reset your target setting back to `select` after you've clicked on someone.
  - It should be noted that, due to how Elemental Battlegrounds is coded, using the `click` target setting will cause your aim to act as if you were shooting in the air. This is not an intended feature and is being worked on, but can be circumvented by jumping/flipping after you've set it.
    - ...though, for the most part, if you're using the `click` target setting, you're probably not doing much aiming, are you?
- [`+`] From now on, EBGui's birthday will be met with fanfare and *Golden* confetti! That's right; every year for the entire day of August 21st, everyone will get free Gold to use for the day.

#### v3.1.2

- [`*`] Fixed a serious key handling problem that nearly brought EBGui to its proverbial knees.  
- [`*`] Promo key for above.  
- [`*`] Shutdown cleanup now properly checks that certain things exist before trying to destroy them.

#### v3.1.1

- [`*`] Fixed a problem with Standard ESP that caused it to incorrectly appear even while disabled.  
- [`*`] Fixed lag caused by Standard and Detailed ESP's respective holders and information not being properly cleared.  
- [`*`] Anti-AFK has been optimized, and the counter has been returned.  

#### v3.1

- [`*`] Changed a few internal names to improve performance.  
- [`*`] Made Anti-AFK stop spamming you.  
- [`-`] You can no longer `;teleport` to the Tournament or Mega maps.  
  - Teleporting to these maps have been patched since Solar's update, and attempting to do so at all results in an instant kick.  
- [`*`] You no longer need to remember cryptic names for `;teleport`. Now, you can simply type in their names normally (with or without capitals) and it will work fine! For example, `;teleport Standard Low` will teleport you properly to the under-40 Standard.  
- [`+`] Re-added the `;refresh` command. Now, `;refresh` will instantly reset and refresh your character! Keep in mind due to how this works, it can't be used to evade death.  
  - Also has an alias, `;re`.  
- [`*`] `;rejoin` now has an alias `;rj`.  
- [`*`] Anti-lag will now properly stop lag.  
- [`+`] Promo key capabilities have been properly added.  
- [`*`] Infinite Sprint now works properly.  
- [`*`] The text for the auto-disabling of conflicting moves will now tell you the spell type it disabled (e.g. "Disabled Fire AoE" vs. "Disabled Fire").  
- [`*`] Fixed an issue with Space-Time Rupture where it wouldn't properly disable.  

#### v3.0.1

- [`*`] Changed the keybind to focus the Command Box, as a recent Roblox update caused the previous one (backslash) to not work.

#### v3.0

- [`*`] Enabling a hack with conflicting spell types (e.g. Blaze Column and Murky Missiles, as AoEs) will now automatically disable the previously enabled move.  
- [`*`] Random Shard Colors will now only change the shard once rather than constantly.  
- [`*`] Renamed `;e` to `;echoes`.  
- [`+`] `;echoes` now has two arguments; `phase` and `auto`. `phase` will accept "POW", "BRN", "STN", or a number 1 through 3, and acts identical to how `;e` used to. `auto` accepts "t" or "on" and "f" or "off", or alternatively takes no other arguments. The former will turn auto-targeting on or off, while the latter simply toggles its current state.  
- [`*`] Orbital Strike Hack now fires 500 studs above the target, sending them flying into the air.  
- [`*`] Light Orbs Hack now fires 5 studs below the target, making them guaranteed to hit while on solid ground (which they should be if you're trying to hit them anyway).  
- [`*`] Fixed a problem with Hyperrang Hack not properly "turning off" when disabling it.
- [`+`] Added 33 more loading quotes.  
- [`+`] Added 16 more crash quotes.  
- [`*`] Certain dates will now add a blurb above the EBGui loading art.  
- [`-`] Removed "GUI successfully loaded!" output in console, as the crash handler took its function as debugger.  
- [`*`] Changed the font... again.
- [`*`] Changed the colors to clash less.  
- [`+`] Re-added `;desp` (now with 100% more functionality).  
- [`+`] Added `;antiafk`, an anti-AFK functionality that should've been added eons ago. Also includes a counter of how many times it's saved you from disconnection.  
- [`+`] Re-added Gold feature coloring. Features which require EBGui Gold will now be gold in color.  
- [`-`] Removed "(G)" prefix from in front of Gold hacks.

#### v2.13

- [`*`] Standard and Detailed ESPs will now properly disable and go away when quitting EBGui.  
- [`+`] Added "Explode at Mouse". While enabled, you can press C to spawn a Lightning Bolt explosion at the feet of your foes or instantly smack someone ulting, even from across the map!  
- [`+`] Added "Space-Time Rupture Hack". Open up the wrath of a Time Lord by placing multiple explosions at your enemy's location.  
- [`*`] Fixed Solar Stick Bug's name becoming "Solar Freeze" after you've clicked the button.

#### v2.12

- [`*`] Anti-Lag will now properly remove Light Disk continuously, as it should've initially.  
- [`+`] Added 20 new randomized quotes that show up on launch!  
- [`*`] Changed "Double Ray Hack" to be "Instant Double Ray" to match with the standard of the "Instant" versus "Hack" naming conventions.  
- [`+`] Added "Remove Ult Cooldown". You can now remove your ult cooldown that's imposed on reset/refresh.  
- [`+`] Added Solar Stick Bug. Fire it to stick your opponents in place!  
- [`*`] Alt Farm will now teleport you to one of three potential locations while enabled, keeping teleport checks at bay and allowing you a specific place each time it's enabled to go to. The location will change if you en- and re-enable it.  
- [`*`] The Docs now have flavor text for the buttons cuz I was bored.  
- [`*`] Changed "Target RQed" to "Target left" when your target leaves the game.  

#### v2.11

<sup>The biggest EBGui update EVER.</sup>

- [`+`] Added a crash handler that will provide a crash log and error message in the console if something goes wrong.  
- [`*`] Fixed a problem with Spectral Embodiment's keybind where it wouldn't fire.  
- [`*`] You no longer need both a Gold Key and a standard Key in your script to load EBGui if you have Gold; you'll now just need the Gold Key.  
- [`*`] `;help` will now copy the link directing you to the [Documentation](/Docs.md).  
- [`*`] `;changelog` will now copy the link directing you here, to the changelog.  
- [`*`] Fixed some text scaling with the Main Menu.  
- [`-`] Temporarily removed the drop teleport buttons, as teleporting to drops currently is unreliable.  
- [`*`] Changed the font of EBGui to a rounder, less-angular font.

#### v2.10

- [`*`] Fixed the problem with Detailed ESP was off-center from the player it was attached to.  
- [`*`] Detailed ESP now has funky colors!  
- [`*`] Potentially fixed an issue regarding the ESP lag.

#### v2.8.2

- [`*`] Fixed an issue with Instant Chain Hack where it would take mana but not fire.

#### v2.8

- [`*`] Fixed a problem with Infinite Sprint where dying would require to you toggle it off and back on.  
- [`*`] Fixed a problem regarding Detailed ESP where using it for an extended period of time would cause lag.

#### v2.7.2

- [`*`] Fixed an issue where Detailed ESP wouldn't update properly if a player died or joined after it was enabled.

#### v2.7.1

- [`*`] Fixed an issue regarding the recent Detailed ESP update where a misnamed function caused both ESPs to function erratically and irregularly.

#### v2.7

- [`+`] Added "Detailed ESP" as a Gold feature. The Detailed ESP will provide not just location and health akin to the standard ESP, but will also show users' Mana and Stamina.  
  - Keep in mind, unfortunately, that due to the nature of how the two are stored, there is no way to tell when it increases until another one of the two values update. This means if someone sprints for a split second and stops, their Stamina won't rise again until they either sprint, flip, get punched, or use a move.  
- [`+`] Added "Infinite Stamina" as a Gold feature. Enable this, and sprinting will no longer cost you any Stamina! Say goodbye to the days of using Speedhack and potentially making it obvious, this one relies entirely on your sprinting status and is virtually undetectable by others!  
- [`*`] Fixed an issue where ESPs sometimes refused to update themselves back to normal if something got caught. It should now properly reset itself.  

#### v2.6

- [`+`] Added `;info <info>` command. The two arguments you can provide are "status" and "github", the former providing the working status as shown in the Discord, and the latter providing the link to the very repo you're looking at.  
- [`+`] Added `;update` command. If your version is current, it will tell you no update is needed. If it isn't, it will tell you you're outdated and give the current version number.  
  - There is no progress on the `;farm` command, and it's been disabled until a fix can be found. Currently, it appears that Genesis Ray just refuses to fire at the anchor in question and opts to go way past it or deflect away from it. While the cause is unknown, we're looking into it!  

#### v2.5

- [`+`] (v2.5) Added command `;farm`. `;farm` will create a small, blue orb way up in the sky that makes creating Genesis Ray setups significantly easier, without the hassle of needing multiple accounts up acting as anchors.  
- [`*`] ~~(Update v2.5.1) Fixed issue with above in which the command send you so high up Genesis Ray stopped working.~~ This issue is still ongoing and will be updated as soon as possible.

#### v2.4.1

- [`*`] Fixed an issue where, after a target leaves, some keybinds wouldn't work because they left. It should now properly recalibrate to yourself.  

#### v2.4

- [`*`] Moved some stuff around to be more organized. All the bullets in one place, all the AoEs in another.  
- [`*`] Fixed an issue where spacing of the Gold buttons caused options at the bottom of the UI to be cut off (namely, Loop TP to Target, ESP, and Teleport to Drops).  
- [`*`] Removed the button coloring and instead opted for a simple "(G)" indicator for Gold hacks.  
  - The Gold coloring will return soon, but currently all implementations have failed and caused issues.  
- [`+`] Added Creation's Continuous Strikes as a Gold hack.  
- [`+`] Added Reaper's Ult (Reaper's Rage) as a Gold hack. 

#### v2.3

- [`+`] Added a welcome message for Master List users.  
  - Considering the very small number of people who will have Master List access, this may seem redundant, but it's neat so who cares.  
- [`*`] Fixed an issue with Instant Crystal Armament where its text's starting value read "On".  
- [`*`] Did some performance cleanup involving the constant indexing of something that was already declared.  
- [`-`] Completely removed "ebguicast" as it was useless.  
  - While the idea of having a cheeky branding option in-game was fun to start, technical limitations and the overall brand change of EBGui just didn't line up.  
- [`*`] Made the "terminate UI" text below the main window less ambiguous.  
- [`+`] Added a functionality where EBGui Gold members would have "EBGui Gold" instead of "EBGui" in the text above the buttons.  
- [`+`] Running `;heal` will now also use Angelic Aura if you use it on yourself.

#### v2.2

- [`+`] Added EBGui Gold  
  - This new premium version of EBGui is intended to give thanks to members who support the project financially by providing them with a selection of hacks that were deemed "too powerful" for standard users to use!  
- [`*`] Made Orbital Strike a Gold hack.  
- [`*`] Made Slime Buddies a Gold hack.  
- [`*`] Made Double Ray a Gold hack.  
- [`*`] Made Instant Dispersion a Gold hack.  

#### v2.1

- [`+`] Added Storm's Lightning Dispersion.  
  - This fires instantly, and will still fire even when in the air.  
- [`+`] Added Darkness' Murky Missiles.  
  - Like most AoEs of its kind, you need to be near the target for it to work.  
- [`+`] Added Technology's Hyperangs.  
- [`+`] Added Slime's Slime Buddies.  
- [`*`] Changed "Crystal Armament Hack" to "Instant Crystal Armament".  
  - The original intention of the move was patched beyond repair, but the current implementation still allowed for instant use of the move without warning, so it was kept.  
- [`+`] Added Technology's Orbital Strike.  
- [`-`] Removed "Amplified Luminous Dispersion."  
  - This was patched well beyond repair eons ago, and simply was never removed.  
- [`-`] Removed "Enable Sans Immunity" and "Teleport to Sans".  
  - The original intention of the above was for sansing to be made more consistent and easy, but with the addition of the teleport confirmation both of most executors and in-game, it was made impossible to do so; thus, the decision to remove the two options was made.

#### v2.0

- [`+`] Added Solar's Double Ray.  
  - You need to be close by the opponent for it to fire, much like Instant Blaze, Vine Trap, and Skeleton Grab.  
- [`+`] Added Storm's Lightning Barrage.  
- [`+`] Added Spirit's Vigor Gyration.  
- [`+`] Added Space's Asteroid Belt.  
- [`-`] Removed Infinite Flame Body, Invisible Infinit Flame Body, and Hide Flames.  
- [`*`] Changed "Infinite Rock Armor" to "Instant Rock Armor".  
  - Most, if not all, body move scripts across the board for EBG have been patched, rendering the Flame Body scripts useless. Rock Armor almost went too, but it was found that it would let you use Rock Armor while moving, so it was just rebranded.  
- [`-`] Removed anything relating to CBring (client bringing).  
  - Loopbring-based scripts were patched beyond repair, and the implementation here was buggy even prior to that. It didn't make sense to beat the dead horse.  
- [`-`] Remove the "Rejoin Server" button.  
  - Using the command `;rejoin` will still work fine.  

#### v1.7.1

- [`+`] Added a blocklist to prevent specific user from accessing the script, key or not.  
- [`+`] Added a masterlist to allow specific users to access the script, key or not.  
- [`*`] Fixed the "welcome" art on successful load to be more in-line.  
- [`*`] Changed the overall style of the UI, including animations.  

#### v1.7

- [`+`] A key is now required to load the script properly. Keys can be found in the Discord.  
- [`+`] Changed how the loading text appears in the developer's console. Now it has fun ASCII text art!  
      - You'll be notified if your key is incorrect/nonexistent in a similar fashion.  

#### v1.6.6

- [`*`] The top status bar will now show the current user's name rather than "Earth".  
- [`-`] Removed "ebguicast" as it was causing medals to simply stop appearing entirely.  

#### v1.6.5

- [`*`] Changed the text command from "e" to "echoes" to prevent interference with other commands.  
  - Note to self, the letter E really causes a LOT of issues.  
- [`+`] Added command "ebguicast", which will change every emblem to the EBGui logo.  

#### v1.6.4

- [`*`] Fixed an issue where "magiccolor" changed the color of Shards and Diamonds.  
  - An issue where the color of Crystal spells also changes exists. The cause is known, but unable to be changed due to how the game handles the moves themselves.

#### v1.6.3

- [`*`] Fixed an issue where "magiccolor" would change the color of players on the server.  
- [`*`] Changed the keybind of Longflash from "E" to backtick.
